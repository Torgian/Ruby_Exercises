# Ruby_Exercises

Chapter Two exercises: These files have a few of the exercises combined.

###Chapter Two exercise "name.rb" combines Exercises 1, 3, and 4 in
	Chapter Two "Variables". Exercise 5 was written simply to show the
	errors when run.  

#Chapter Six Arrays

Exercise 7 was worded strangely: Write a program that iterates over an
 array and builds a new array that is the result of incrementing each
 value in the original array by a value of 2. 

Does this mean to return an array where each index is the product of
the index plus 2?

Or, does it mean to return only every second element of the array after
the zero element? 

I wrote exercise seven to include both. 

I also wrote the exercise to return two different types of iterated arrays:
one wehre every element that is the modulo of 2 is returned, and the other where
every element that returns a remainder. 

So, array[0], [2], [4], etc returns in the [index % 2] version
And also array [1], [3], [5] etc returns in the [index % 2 == 1] version
